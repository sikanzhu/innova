              Apache Commons Pool 2.4.2 RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Commons Pool team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Commons Pool 2.4.2.

Apache Commons Pool provides an object-pooling API and a number of object pool implementations.
Version 2 contains a completely re-written pooling implementation compared to the 1.x series.
In addition to performance and scalability improvements, version 2 includes robust instance
tracking and pool monitoring. Version 2 requires JDK level 1.6 or above. 

No client code changes are required to migrate from versions 2.0-2.3 to version 2.4.2.
Users of version 1.x should consult the migration guide on the Commons Pool web site.

NOTE: The MBean interfaces (DefaultPooledObjectInfoMBean, GenericKeyedObjectPoolMXBean
      and GenericKeyedObjectPoolMXBean) exist only to define the attributes and methods
      that will be made available via JMX. They must not be implemented by clients as
      they are subject to change between major, minor and patch version releases of
      Commons Pool. Clients that implement any of these interfaces may not, therefore,
      be able to upgrade to a new minor or patch release without requiring code
      changes.

This is a patch release, including bug fixes only.

Changes in version 2.4.2 include:


Fixed Bugs:
o POOL-298:  Changed default jmxNameBase in BaseObjectPoolConfig to the correct (null)
             default.
o POOL-300:  Added PrintWriter flush to DefaultPooledObject's printStackTrace method.
